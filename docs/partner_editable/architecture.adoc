As shown in <<architecture1>> and <<architecture2>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
** An internet-facing Classic Load Balancer (ELB) for routing traffic to the content delivery web server.
* In the private subnets:
** Content management EC2 instances are designed for active/passive standby and are not part of an Auto Scaling Group.
** Content delivery EC2 instances are deployed into an Auto Scaling group.
** Content delivery web server EC2 instances are deployed into an Auto Scaling group.
** Content management web server EC2 instances are deployed into an Auto Scaling group.
** Utility EC2 instances are deployed into their own Auto Scaling group.
** An internal ELB for routing traffic to the active content management server.
** An internal ELB for routing traffic to the content management web server.
* Amazon CloudFront for content delivery.
* EC2 Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for each AEM OpenCloud role.
* AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for storing SSL certificates.
* Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring deployed services.
* AWS Lambda to support provisioning of AEM OpenCloud on AWS.
* Amazon Route 53 private hosted zone for internal Domain Name System (DNS) lookups.
* AWS Secrets Manager to store the AEM keystore password & AEM SSL private key.
* Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) for receiving Auto scaling group alarm notifications.
* Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) for forwarding Auto scaling group alarm notifications to Utility EC2 instances.
* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket for storing AEM OpenCloud Stack assets.
* AWS Systems Manager to store AEM OpenCloud configuration parameters.

*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips
the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC
configuration.
