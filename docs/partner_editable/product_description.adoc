The {partner-product-name} workloads are deployed on multiple Amazon EC2 instances for improved performance. The content-delivery and content-management web server roles can be scaled for high availability. Other {partner-product-name} roles have restrictions on active/active roles and are designed for active/passive standby. Due to this, other {partner-product-name} roles belong to their own Auto Scaling groups as single instances. Should an instance become unavailable, it’s replaced by a new instance and configured with a {partner-product-name} role of the same type.

Website content can be deployed to the content-delivery and content-management roles using your choice of deployment process.
