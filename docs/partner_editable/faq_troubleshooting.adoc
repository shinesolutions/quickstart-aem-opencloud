== FAQ

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *No*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stack‚Äôs state is retained and the instance is left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue.

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Please make sure to delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^] on the AWS website.

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template size limitations. For more information about AWS CloudFormation quotas, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].

*Q.* Where are the deployment logs?

*A.* All resources and logs for deployments are found either in Amazon CloudWatch Logs or in the instances themselves.

* All log files of the Lambda functions can be found in Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

* Installation logfiles of the AEM OpenCloud roles can be found in the EC2 instances at `/var/log/cloud-init.log` and `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`.

* Log files of the AEM OpenCloud Main Stack are found either in Amazon Cloudwatch Logs by the AOC Stack Prefix & name of the log file (e.g., `aoc-stack-1/var/log/shinesolutions/puppet-stack-init.log`) or in the EC2 instances at `/var/log/shinesolutions/puppet-stack-init.log`, `/var/log/cloud-init.log`, and `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`.

*Q.* Where are the AEM System Users Login Credentials stored?

*A.* The login credentials of the AEM System users are stored on S3 in the AEM OpenCloud Stack data directory `s3://S3DataBucketName/AOCStackPrefix/system-users-credentials.json` (e.g., `s3://aem-opencloud/aoc-stack-1/system-users-credentials.json`.)

*Q.* Which versions of Oracle Java JDK8 are supported by AEM OpenCloud?

*A.* All versions of Oracle Java JDK8 are supported. You just need to provide the version e.g. `8u271` as input value for the parameter `JavaJDKVersion`

*Q.* What versions of AEM are supported by AEM OpenCloud?

*A.* Supported versions of AEM and their allowed input value for the parameter `AemVersion` including the expected name of the Service-Packs are listed in the table below.

== Troubleshooting

=== General Troubleshooting notes:
* If the stack `AmiCreationStack` failed to create, the installation of the AEM OpenCloud roles failed. Start troubleshooting by analysing the log files in the EC2 instances or the Lambda logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

* The EC2 instances of the stack `AemOpenCloudMainStack` have the EC2 tag `ComponentInitStatus`, which helps to determine the provisioning state of the EC2 instances.

The Tag `ComponentInitStatus` can contain three values:

*InProgress*:
The provisioning of the AEM OpenCloud role is still in progress.

*Success*:
The provisioning of the AEM OpenCloud role was successful.

*Failed*:
The provisioning of the AEM OpenCloud role failed.

image::../images/ec2_tag_componentinitstatus.png[ec2_tag_componentinitstatus,width=648,height=439]

* Amazon CloudWatch Logs contains all important log files of each main AEM OpenCloud role. Some important logs which support you troubleshooting are listed below.

*General Logs:*
```
/var/log/shinesolutions/puppet-stack-init.log
/var/log/cloud-init.log
/var/log/cloud-init-output.log
```

*Role specific Logs:*
```
/opt/aem/author/crx-quickstart/logs/error.log
/opt/aem/publish/crx-quickstart/logs/error.log

/var/log/httpd/access_log
/var/log/httpd/dispatcher.log
/var/log/httpd/error_log

/opt/shinesolutions/aem-orchestrator/orchestrator.log
```

=== Troubleshooting by Error messages:
* ```OrchestratorAutoScalingGroup Received 1 FAILURE signal(s) out of 1.  Unable to satisfy 100% MinSuccessfulInstancesPercent requirement.```

Troubleshooting this error requires you to analyse the Orchestrator role logs on the EC2 instance:
```
/var/log/cloud-init-output.log
/opt/shinesolutions/aem-orchestrator/orchestrator.log
```

*/var/log/cloud-init-output.log*:

Analyse this log file for the test results of the AEM OpenCloud readiness check.


A successful component readiness check:
```
inspec exec . --show-progress --controls=\ author-primary-instance-provisioned-successful
.
Profile: AEM-AWS InSpec profile (aem-aws)
Version: 1.10.0
Target: local://
 ‚úî author-primary-instance-provisioned-successful: Check if Author Primary instance has been provisioned successful
 ‚úî ready is expected to have author primary instance been successful provision
Profile Summary: 1 successful control, 0 control failures, 0 controls skipped
Test Summary: 1 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped
```

A failed component readiness check:
```
inspec exec . --show-progress --controls=\ author-primary-instance-provisioned-successful
F
Profile: AEM-AWS InSpec profile (aem-aws)
Version: 1.10.0
Target: local://
   √ó  author-primary-instance-provisioned-successful: Check if Author Primary instance has been provisioned successful
      √ó  ready is expected to have author primary instance been successful provision
   expected #has_author_primary_instance_been_successful_provision? to return true, got false
Profile Summary: 0 successful controls, 1 control failure, 0 controls skipped
Test Summary: 0 successful, 1 failure, 0 skipped
```

A running component readiness check:
```
inspec exec . --show-progress --controls=\ author-standby-instance-provisioned-successful
```

If a readiness check failed for an AEM OpenCloud role, start analysing the deployment logs of the failed role.


If the readiness check passed or was still running at the time of the failure start analysing the orchestrator log.



*/opt/shinesolutions/aem-orchestrator/orchestrator.log*:

The orchestrator log contains all log messages of all orchestration event.

This message indicates that the Orchestrator was unable to download the `system-users-credentials` file from S3. This happens if the `system-users-credentials` file was deleted or if the `S3DataBucket` is not in the same Region in which the AEM OpenCloud Quick Start is deployed.
```
DEBUG c.s.a.c.AemConfig$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$$56cbacf8 - Reading AEM credentials from S3 bucket
ERROR c.s.a.c.AemConfig$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$$56cbacf8 - Failed to read AEM credentials file from S3 location: s3://aem-opencloud/aoc-stack-1/system-users-credentials.json
```

If reading the AEM credentials from S3 was successful and the orchestrator log is showing no more log messages after the following log message:
```
[main] INFO  c.s.aemorchestrator.AemOrchestrator - Waiting for Author ELB to be in healthy state
```

It indicates that the provisioning of the Author-Primary role has not finished yet. Follow the guidelines described in the general troubleshooting notes for analysing errors for an AEM OpenCloud Role.
